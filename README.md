# Text-to-image-generator-
- **Install Required Libraries:**
  - Use !pip install --upgrade diffusers transformers -q to install and upgrade the diffusers and transformers libraries.
    
- **Import Necessary Modules:**
  - Import essential Python libraries such as Path, tqdm, torch, pandas, numpy, and cv2.
  - Import StableDiffusionPipeline from diffusers and functions from transformers
    
- **Define Configuration Class (CFG):**
    - Set up the configuration for image generation, including:
      - device as "cuda".
      - seed for reproducibility.
      - image_gen_steps for the number of inference steps.
      - image_gen_model_id for the model identifier.
      - image_gen_size for the output image dimensions.
      - image_gen_guidance_scale for guidance scale in image generation.
      - prompt_gen_model_id for the prompt generation model.
      - prompt_dataset_size and prompt_max_length for prompt configurations.

- **Load the Stable Diffusion Model:**
  - Load the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained.
  - Configure the model for the "fp16" revision and set it to the specified device (cuda).

- **Fetch Model Files:**
  - Attempt to fetch necessary files for the Stable Diffusion pipeline, including tokenizers and model binaries.

- **Define Image Generation Function:**
   - Create a function generate_image that:
     - Accepts a text prompt and a model.
     - Generates an image using the specified model configuration.
     - Resizes the generated image to the specified dimensions.
    
- **Call generate_image("white tiger with goggles", image_gen_model) to generate an image based on the prompt.**

**Note:-**
- In the context of the text-to-image generator provided, setting device as "cuda" means utilizing an NVIDIA GPU to accelerate the model's computations.
- CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture): is a parallel computing platform and API model created by NVIDIA. It allows developers to use the GPU for general-purpose processing, which is typically much faster 
  for tasks like deep learning model inference and training.
- In text-to-image generation, models like StableDiffusionPipeline from diffusers use substantial computational resources. Setting the device to "cuda" ensures that the heavy computational tasks (e.g., 
  forward passes, inference steps) are offloaded to the GPU instead of being processed by the CPU, which is slower for such tasks.
